## Project Post Mortem

#### Approach and Process

1. What in our process and approach to this project would we do differently next time?

* ERD could have been more detailed before we move on to the rest of the project

* Might be useful to have a sitemap up at the start so that everyone is clear on how the pages interact with one another

* More communication is needed to get everybody on the same page, and that when someone is waiting on another person, we need to sync up

2. What in our process and approach to this project went well that we would repeat next time?

* Pair coding is good for debugging, and for a fresh perspective

#### Code and Code Design

1. What in our code and program design in the project would we do differently next time?

* Use a different framework because it is hard to isolate problems in Rails

2. What in our code and program design in the project went well? Is there anything we would do the same next time?

  For each, please include code examples that each team member wrote.
  1. Code snippet up to 20 lines.
  2. Code design documents or architecture drawings / diagrams.

#### WDI Unit 3 Post Mortem (individual)
1. What habits did I use during this unit that helped me?



* Kenneth: Really going step by step is important, troubleshooting (finding out what caused the error is also crucial) plays a key role in understanding the new language. Continuous experimentation and perseverance is the key ingredients to success for a new language. The basic of input, process and output are the 3 key concept in any language.


2. What habits did I have during this unit that I can improve on?



* Kenneth: Better communication. Sometimes, it doesn't hurt to ask.

3. How is the overall level of the course during this unit? (instruction, course materials, etc.)

* Kenneth: If I were to be honest, I am extremely lost for this topic. I really had to do my self reading to learn and figure things out. Course material was generally alright but it could seriously improve.
